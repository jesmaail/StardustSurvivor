DeciGames Asteroid game

Game has been ported across from Phaser 2 Javascript to Phaser 3 Typescript :tada:

# TODO
## Improvements
- Linting and better Typescript formatting
    - Research best practices etc.
    - VSCode tooling & extensions
- Add more simple textures than my old handmades
- Add image and audio keys as constants for more consistent access
- Abstract logic out of main.ts
- Encapsulate behaviours
    - e.g. Ship, Asteroids, Powerups.
- Improve asteroid spawning pattern
    - Preserve old behaviour as "2014 mode"
- Countdown for powerup durations
